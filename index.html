            <h1>What I can do for you</h1>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I mostly focus on <a href="http://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django framework</a> and can build new project for you using Django or improve existing one. I don't mind to work on someone else's code.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can also do anything related to JavaScript. <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> is my tool of choice but I have some experience with different frameworks like <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">backbone.js</a> . I'm familiar with advanced javascript concepts like closures or modules as described in Douglas Crockford's book: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742" target="_blank">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>". By the way, really great book.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm also familiar with HTML/CSS and can do simple fixes if needed or handle CSS framework like <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter's Bootstrap</a>. But please, do not expect me to turn psd files into working HTML/CSS layout.
            </li>
            <li>
              I usually manage Linux servers for my clients so I should have no problems dealing with your setup whatever it is. So far I managed <a href="http://webfaction.com" target="_blank">WebFaction</a> and <a href="http://linode.com" target="_blank">Linode</a> accounts but I can deal with any Linux based VPS or dedicated server. I use <a href="http://fabfile.org" target="_blank">fabric</a> for automatic deployment.
            </li>
            <li>
              I know my way around relational databases, especially <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" blank="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>. I can install database on your server, setup backups, design tables layout, preform data migration using <a href="http://south.readthedocs.org/en/0.7.6/index.html" target="_blank">South</a> if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              I use version control systems as one of my basic tools. I mostly use <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> these days but I'm also familiar with <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com" target="_blank">Baazar (bzr)</a>, <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank">Subversion (svn)</a> and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_blank">Mercurial (hg)</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="alert alert-info">
            But these are just technical skills - I'm pretty sure all other software developers have them too. But with time I also discovered that there is more than that.
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>I'm reliable</strong>: I keep my deadlines and don't disappear in the middle of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I'm independent</strong> and can work with no supervision so you won't need to hold my hand all the time ;) Actually, I hate being micromanaged and fire customers that try to do that.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can not only code but also give a lot of <strong>helpful suggestions</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have <strong>experience with bigger projects</strong> and know how to build <strong>clean and readable code</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              And of course I have very <strong>high attention to detail</strong> - I won't neglect privileges check or more complex validation rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not to mention my <strong>communications skills</strong>. Nothing more annoying than having 3 iterations just to 'force' the developer to follow the instructions to the letter - it's like they don't really read them ;) I also use bullet points a lot, try to write about one thing per email, love sending close-ended emails to save my client's time.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm <strong>willing to learn new things</strong>. Web development is very broad subject with plenty of different tools. It's not possible to know everything so learning new things is very important for us, developers.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm also <strong>don't mind to wear many hats</strong>. Most of my clients are individuals or small companies and hiring a backend developer, database administrator and server administrator is usually an overkill. I can do all of that myself. I must admit I'm probably not a great server or database administrator, but I'm good enough to keep things up and running before your project grow big enough to extend your team.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            At the end I will just say that so far all my previous clients were very happy so I probably <strong>know what am I doing</strong> ;)
          </p>

            Tomasz was an excellent contractor and I will definitely be using him again for future projects. He was very easy to work with, gave good suggestions for improvements and was always quick to respond to my emails. His skills were evident within a day of working with him as he had assessed the buggy code that was causing problems for my client, summarized all the potential issues and given me estimates on time to complete. This made my life a lot easier and at the end of the day my client is very happy with the results which speaks for itself. Thanks Tomasz. I look forward to working with you again.
